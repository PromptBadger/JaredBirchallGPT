# JaredBirchallGPT is a project where I want to learn new things and share things I know. 
I name it like Elon Musk right hand and most trusted financial advisor. 
At first I used it to train Jared model but now I'm working on development of an IDE but for AI training. 

#Features on Future:
-Save input text log to keep learning as in a chat.

-Autonomous version like(AutoGPT)
-Prompt sintaxis(like software but for prompting)
-Much more!!


#For who?
